 *           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 *           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 *           the Derivative Works; and
 *
 *       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 *           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 *           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 *           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 *           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 *           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 *           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 *           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 *           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 *           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 *           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 *           as modifying the License.
 *
 *       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *
 *    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 *
 *    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 *
 *    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
 *
 *       To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
 *       boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
 *       replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
 *       the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
 *       comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
 *       file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
 *       same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier

/**
 * <p>
 * Object-Relational-Mapping via Hibernate. Exposes an {@link EntityManagerFactory} and
 * {@link EntityManager}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This module extends {@link Jdbc} module, before going forward, make sure you read the doc of the
 * {@link Jdbc} module first.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This module provides an advanced and recommended <a href=
 * "https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/OpenSessionInView#jive_content_id_Can_I_use_two_transactions_in_one_Session"
 * >Open Session in View</a> pattern, which basically keep the {@link Session} opened until the view
 * is rendered, but it uses two database transactions: 1) first transaction is committed before
 * rendering the view and then 2) a read only transaction is opened for rendering the view.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h1>usage</h1>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   use(new Hbm(EntityA.class, EntityB.class));
 *
 *   get("/", req {@literal ->} {
 *    EntityManager em = req.require(EntityManager.class);
 *    // work with em...
 *   });
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * At bootstrap time you will see something similar to this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@literal *} /{@literal *}{@literal *} [{@literal *}/{@literal *}] [{@literal *}/{@literal *}] (hbm)
 * </pre>
 *
 * That is the filter with the <strong>Open Session in View</strong> pattern.
 *
 * <h1>life-cycle</h1>
 *
 * <p>
 * You are free to inject an {@link EntityManagerFactory} create a new
 * {@link EntityManagerFactory#createEntityManager()}, start transactions and do everything you
 * need.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For the time being, this doesn't work for an {@link EntityManager}. An {@link EntityManager} is
 * bound to the current request, which means you can't freely access from every single thread (like
 * manually started thread, started by an executor service, quartz, etc...).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Another restriction, is the access from {@link Singleton} services. If you need access from a
 * singleton services, you need to inject a {@link Provider}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * &#64;Singleton
 * public class MySingleton {
 *
 *   &#64;Inject
 *   public MySingleton(Provider&lt;EntityManager&gt; em) {
 *     this.em = em;
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * This is because the {@link EntityManager} is bound as {@link RequestScoped}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Still, we strongly recommend to leave your services in the default scope and avoid to use
 * {@link Singleton} objects, except of course for really expensive resources. This is also
 * recommend it by Guice.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Services in the default scope won't have this problem and are free to inject the
 * {@link EntityManager} directly.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h1>persistent classes</h1>
 * <p>
 * Classpath scanning is OFF by default, so you need to explicitly tell Hibernate which classes are
 * persistent. This intentional and helps to reduce bootstrap time and have explicit control over
 * persistent classes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you don't care about bootstrap time and/or just like the auto-discover feature, just do:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   use(new Hbm().scan());
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * After calling {@link #scan(String...)}, Hibernate will auto-discover all the entities
 * application's
 * namespace. The namespace is defined by the package of your application. Given:
 * <code>org.myproject.App</code> it will scan everything under <code>org.myproject</code>.
 *
 * <h1>options</h1>
 *
 * <p>
 * Hibernate options can be set from your <code>application.conf</code> file, just make sure to
 * prefix them with <code>hibernate.*</code>
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto = update
 * </pre>
